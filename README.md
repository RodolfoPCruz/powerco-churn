## 1. Project Overview
Following the liberalization of Europeâ€™s energy market, PowerCo experienced high churn rates among SME customers.  
The objective of this project is to:
- **Predict** which SME customers are at risk of churning.
- **Evaluate** the effect of price changes on churn probability.
- **Support** retention strategies, including a proposed 20% discount for high-risk customers.

By anticipating churn, PowerCo can take proactive measures to retain customers and optimize pricing strategie

## 2. Data Description

> The dataset contains historical information on PowerCoâ€™s SME customers and is provided in two CSV files:

> 1. **clients_data.csv** â€“ contains customer information.
> 2. **price_data.csv** â€“ contains historical energy price data.
>
> ### **Features in `clients_data.csv`**
>
> - **id** â€“ client company identifier
> - **channel_sales** â€“ sales channel code
> - **cons_12m** â€“ electricity consumption over the past 12 months
> - **cons_gas_12m** â€“ gas consumption over the past 12 months
> - **cons_last_month** â€“ electricity consumption in the last month
> - **date_activ** â€“ contract activation date
> - **date_end** â€“ registered contract end date
> - **date_modif_prod** â€“ date of the last product modification
> - **date_renewal** â€“ date of the next contract renewal
> - **forecast_cons_12m** â€“ forecasted electricity consumption for the next 12 months
> - **forecast_cons_year** â€“ forecasted electricity consumption for the next calendar year
> - **forecast_discount_energy** â€“ forecasted value of the current discount
> - **forecast_meter_rent_12m** â€“ forecasted meter rental cost for the next 12 months
> - **forecast_price_energy_off_peak** â€“ forecasted electricity price for the 1st period (off-peak)
> - **forecast_price_energy_peak** â€“ forecasted electricity price for the 2nd period (peak)
> - **forecast_price_pow_off_peak** â€“ forecasted power price for the 1st period (off-peak)
> - **has_gas** â€“ indicates whether the client also has a gas subscription
> - **imp_cons** â€“ current paid consumption
> - **margin_gross_pow_ele** â€“ gross margin on power subscription
>   - Represents the profit margin from selling electricity subscriptions before accounting for overhead costs (e.g., salaries, rent, administration).
>   - Formula: **Gross Margin** = Revenue from power subscription â€“ Direct costs of supplying power
> - **margin_net_pow_ele** â€“ net margin on power subscription
>   - Indicates actual profit after subtracting all expenses (direct and indirect).
>   - Formula: **Net Profit** = Total Revenue â€“ All Costs (direct costs + operating expenses + taxes + interest + depreciation, etc.)
> - **nb_prod_act** â€“ number of active products and services
> - **net_margin** â€“ total net margin
> - **num_years_antig** â€“ client tenure (in years)
> - **origin_up** â€“ code of the initial electricity campaign the customer subscribed to
> - **pow_max** â€“ contracted maximum power
> - **churn** â€“ indicates whether the client churned within the next 3 months
>
> ### **Features in `price_data.csv`**
>
> - **id** â€“ client company identifier
> - **price_date** â€“ reference date
> - **price_off_peak_var** â€“ variable electricity price for the 1st period (off-peak)
> - **price_peak_var** â€“ variable electricity price for the 2nd period (peak)
> - **price_mid_peak_var** â€“ variable electricity price for the 3rd period (mid-peak)
> - **price_off_peak_fix** â€“ fixed power price for the 1st period (off-peak)
> - **price_peak_fix** â€“ fixed power price for the 2nd period (peak)
> - **price_mid_peak_fix** â€“ fixed power price for the 3rd period (mid-peak)
